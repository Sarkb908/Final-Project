# Final-Project

For my final project, I had attempted to make a personalized blog that describes aspects of my life being a Muslim American Woman. My intentions were to create a piece that gives the user information they would like to read about as they navigate through the page. The home page includes an introduction, with an art piece I did called "Muslim American Girl" that describes the topic. You can go through the menu to read about each and every aspect with corresponding pictures. I added a scroll to the body of my webpage, and my content is presented in two columns.

I attempted to a bunch of different things which had failed. In my wireframe, I had different effects and decorations that I wanted to include. The top header was meant to be very decorative, but due to many failed attempts, I had decided to go with a very minimilsitic design to let the reading and images do the talkng. I also wanted to create an animation with the menu through JQuery but my attempts kept failing. I did however still wished to have a complete look to my webpages and therefore continued to design with HTML and CSS. I also could not figure out how to do a fade with an image on my webpages, which was an attempt that can be seen on the wireframe images.
