           Bald Eagles! Freedom! America! F*CK YEAH! Right? Yep, that’s right. I’m mixed with many things, but no matter what anyone wants to believe, I am an American. First one in my entire family, history actually so I take pride in being the first of many new changes. I’ve been in New York City my entire life and I’ve thrived in the American culture from school, T.V,  even the military at one point, you name it. I wanted to do everything that made me an American because I take pride in the place that I grew up in and has given me all the knowledge and freedom I have today. I have been exposed to many great things that generations before me could only dream of having, but that doesn’t mean that all this freedom comes easy.
 
            <p>My life outside my home is usually kept a secret because most things I do that seem normal is actually not when it comes to my family and particular cultural rules get involved. I live my life tippy toeing around my culture and find myself mostly silent at family parties. I have nothing to discuss that they would take an interest in or be understood.  I find myself isolated from my home, but it doesn’t end there. Many times, America can be cruel to someone like me. Many people dislike Muslims or people of color, and I’ve found myself feeling ashamed of that part of me growing up, although that has changed now. Sometimes people don’t understand why I mostly cover up. They don’t understand why I don’t buy that cute pair of shorts I saw at the store or wear a dress to a nice party and continue to judge because the lack of understanding of the situation I’m in. It’s not that I don’t want to wear shorts or a pretty dress, for example, it’s just it’s too much of a hassle trying to change before I go home or constantly looking around to see if anyone I know will see me in them so I just gave up until I can get out of here. Sometimes, living two lives and not being able to express parts of me really puts a big stump on my life.
