    <h3>Being a Muslim American Woman</h3>

            I was born in Elmhurst, Queens being the first generation American with parents who immigrated directly from Bangladesh. I grew up with a plethora of diversity around me, and my biggest divide always seemed to be the place I came from, and the place I grew up in. I have adapted to the American culture quite well; although my roots and characteristics come from what I was taught at home where Bengali traditions and religious Islamic practice was very well integrated throughout my life. 
            <p>I’ve considered myself all of those things, because they are what make me who I am. I’ve learned a lot throughout my life, gained a lot of experience, and lost a lot by being the Muslim American Woman I am today. It hasn’t always been easy growing up with such a rigid divide in my own home, but I can say the experience has been unique. Growing up was a constant struggle because I faced many contradictions between the two cultures I grew up in, and the two lives I’ve tried to balance.</p> </td>
