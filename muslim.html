<h3>Being Muslim</h3>

            From as long as I can remember, I had multiple religious teachers trying to teach me how to learn Arabic so I could read the Quran. It was always so frustrating because everyone told me that I had to know how to read it to properly pray to God. I spent years learning how to memorize the language, but that was it, it was just memorization. I had no idea what I was reading, therefore I could not spiritually connect with the religion and God. I always asked questions and the answer I always got is “you have to or else it’s a sin.” This is just one example of why growing up Muslim was such a frustrating journey, and how many of the rules and regulations felt meaningless. When I had felt like I gained no knowledge from reading what seemed like gibberish without meaning, I slowly began to give up. It felt like I had a huge barrier between my beliefs and my religion, and felt excluded because everything meant nothing.
            <p>Although I had not understood a lot of the reasons why us Muslims had to do certain things in such way, I recognized the values of Islam brought into my life. I have learned to always spread peace, kindness and be selfless to those brothers and sisters around me. I was taught most of the values that derived from Islam in translation from my mother, although she did not fully understand many things either, due to the similar situation I and many others face with reading Arabic. Growing up, most of the meanings were translated through the word of mouth. Therefore, many reasons became distorted, many things did not make sense, and many interpretations were personal preference or traditional values. When I began to notice this, I stripped away a lot of the bullsh*t and started my part in discovering what my religion means to me.
