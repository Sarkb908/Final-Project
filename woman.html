          The hardest struggle I face today is being a woman. Everywhere around me, I get degraded because of my gender. I grew up in a home where men come first, and the women do whatever the men say. We have to sit in the bedroom during family parties and we eat last. I am meant to get married, have kids and take care of life at home. That was supposed to be my life, and anything I had done outside of that made me a bad woman that everyone looked down upon. I’m 19, almost 20 and I am told that I need to get married before I get too old and no one will want to marry me anymore. I hear comments about women left and right and how she should have done this, or that or when any woman does anything out of or the ordinary it’s a scandal. It’s true, people around the neighborhood has even made up lies about me and talked about me in a degrading matter in a situation that had no reason to involve me. My mom makes me wait before I leave the house because there’s a mosque next to ours and all the men are out. I’m supposed to be late because I am a woman? I’m going to get sinned if I don’t cover up, although I am fully covered, because I am a woman and men will look? Grew up with this sh*t since day one.
 
            <p>Most people would say that my religion is harsher on women than other cultures, but I would have to disagree. Yes, there are some absolutely ridiculous things but it doesn’t stop there. Growing up in America there has been equally ridiculous things just structured differently in a way the American culture accepts. I become over sexualized, or am incapable of certain activities, humor, anything a person can think of. I see women fight for many beliefs I agree with as a woman, and I see them instantly shut down because they are made fun of. Are women really less than the other gender? I just don’t see any reasons why this would be the case except for power, and to feel below really sucks. I’m tired of this unnecessary sh*t every day.
